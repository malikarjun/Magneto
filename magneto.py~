An L2 learning switch.

It is derived from one written live for an SDN crash course.
It is somwhat similar to NOX's pyswitch in that it installs
exact-match rules for each flow.

class LearningSwitch (object):
  """
  The learning switch "brain" associated with a single OpenFlow switch.

  When we see a packet, we'd like to output it on a port which will
  eventually lead to the destination.  To accomplish this, we build a
  table that maps addresses to ports.

  We populate the table by observing traffic.  When we see a packet
  from some source coming from some port, we know that source is out
  that port.

  When we want to forward traffic, we look up the desintation in our
  table.  If we don't know the port, we simply send the message out
  all ports except the one it came in on.  (In the presence of loops,
  this is bad!).

  In short, our algorithm looks like this:

  For each packet from the switch:
  1) Use source address and switch port to update address/port table
  2) Is transparent = False and either Ethertype is LLDP or the packet's
     destination address is a Bridge Filtered address?
     Yes:
        2a) Drop packet -- don't forward link-local traffic (LLDP, 802.1x)
            DONE
  3) Is destination multicast?
     Yes:
        3a) Flood the packet
            DONE
  4) Port for destination address in our address/port table?
     No:
        4a) Flood the packet
            DONE
  5) Is output port the same as input port?
     Yes:
        5a) Drop packet and similar ones for a while
  6) Install flow table entry in the switch so that this
     flow goes out the appopriate port
     6a) Send the packet out appropriate port
